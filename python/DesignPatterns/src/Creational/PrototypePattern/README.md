## Prototype design pattern

Prototype design pattern helps to hide the complexity of the instances created by the class. The concept of the existing object will differ with that of the new object, which is created from scratch.

The newly copied object may have some changes in the properties if required. This approach saves time and resources that go in for the development of a product.
